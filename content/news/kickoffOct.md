PediaMedAI Kickoff meeting on Oct 28th and 29th was tremendously successful! It gathered the team, including all our new and incoming hires, our funders, as well as the VESRI advisory board. It featured amazing talks and sparked insightful discussions. 
Thank you to all who joined us and thank you to our brilliant speakers: Laure Zanna, Pierre Gentine, Paul Oâ€™Gorman, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Ryan Abernathey, Judith Berner and Alistair Adcroft.
