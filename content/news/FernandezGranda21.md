Carlos Fernandez-Granda and co-authors, including Laure Zanna, investigate in this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10734v1.pdf), probability estimation from high-dimensional data using deep neural networks. In particular, they propose a new method for probability estimation, which outperforms existing approaches on simulated as well as on three real-world datasets (including climatology data).
