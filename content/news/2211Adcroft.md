This [article](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abq6974) examines the mechanism that led to the breakup of massive iceberg A68 in Dec 2020. The authors, including **Alistair Adcroft**, demonstrate that the A68a breakup event may have been triggered by ocean-current shear, a new breakup mechanism not previously reported. Their paper was featured in the [news](https://www.livescience.com/iceberg-fracture-currents-southern-ocean).
