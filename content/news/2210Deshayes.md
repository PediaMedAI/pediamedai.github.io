Using the two-scale Lorenz96 model, this [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06243.pdf) evaluates the potential of History Matching to tune a climate system with multi-scale dynamics. This semi-automatic tuning was more efficient when combined with physical expertise. Julie Deshayes and V Balaji are co-authors on this study.
