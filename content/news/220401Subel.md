Using 2D decaying turbulence as a testbed, this [work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999122001528), co-authored by Adam Subel, explores the importance of accurately capturing backscattering in generating stable online LES. Additionally, it shows that transfer learning can enable generalization to flows with a higher Reynolds number, even if an increase in resolution is needed.
