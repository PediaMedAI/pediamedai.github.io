Judith Berner is a co-author in this [article](https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-21-0163.1), which describes the design and prediction skill of two subseasonal prediction systems based on two configurations of the Community Earth System Model, version 2 (CESM2): with the Community Atmosphere Model and with Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model as its atmospheric component. Both systems are compared to NOAA CFSv2 and ECMWF.
