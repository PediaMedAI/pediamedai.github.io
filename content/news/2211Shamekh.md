Cloud and convection take many structure and degrees of organization, which are still absent in most parameterizations. But does that structure matter for precipitation? This [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10512517.1), led by **Sara Shamekh**, proposes an elegant method to include organization in the parameterization of precipitation that results in a significant improvement in predicting precipitation, especially extremes, at GCM scale.
