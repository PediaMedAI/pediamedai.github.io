This [study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05058-5), co-authored by Mitch Bushuk, produced the first ever year-round satellite observational record of Arctic sea ice thickness, employing a deep learning model to produce estimates of sea ice freeboard. These data span the period 2010-2020 and will be critical for better monitoring the changing Arctic climate, advancing climate model evaluation, and improving sea ice predictions.
