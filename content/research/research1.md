Despite drastic improvements in climate model development, current simulations have difficulty capturing the interactions among different processes in the atmosphere, oceans, and ice and how they affect the Earth’s climate; this can hinder projections of temperature, rainfall, and sea level. 
M²LInES will be focusing on understanding these key climate processes using two types of data: 1. Data from high-resolution simulation and observations. 2. Data resulting from model errors, also called data assimilation increments.    
 
Below is a representation of the physical processes that will be studied by the team:

##### From high-resolution simulations and observational data
We will diagnose small-scale physical processes such as:


* Atmospheric convection and clouds (O'Gorman, Yuval)
* Atmospheric boundary layer processes at the ocean and sea-ice interface (Gentine, Connolly)
* Ocean mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (Abernathey, Balwada)
* Ocean submesoscale processes (Le Sommer, Gorbunova)
* Ocean mesoscale momentum, energy and air-sea interactions (Zanna, Perezhogin)
* Vertical mixing (Adcroft, Reichl, Sane)
* Sea-ice heterogeneity and its influence on air-sea-ice interactions (Holland, Zampieri)

##### We will also learn from the data resulting from model errors, or data assimilation increments, illustrated in the figure below:

###### In particular, in this analysis we will be focusing on:

* Atmospheric processes (Berner, Chapman) 
* Ocean processes (Lu, Verma)
* Sea-ice parametrization (Bushuk, Gregory)
* Air-sea-ice fluxes (Berner, Holland, Bushuk, Chapman, Verma, Gregory)
