Lead author Joan Bruna introduces in this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01360.pdf), a method to use deep neural network when training data are initially unavailable: Neural Galerkin schemes integrate time-dependent partial differential equations with deep networks by generating the data needed to advance their solution on-the-fly using importance sampling.
