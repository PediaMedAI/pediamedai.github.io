In this [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.124606), Anastasiia Gorbunova and co-authors study spatio-temporal correlation function of a passive scalar in 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence and synthetic velocity fields, by means of direct numerical simulations. Two regimes of temporal decorrelation are observed: a Gaussian at small time lags and exponential at large time lags. This behaviour is in agreement with recent analytical results.
