Aakash Sane is a co-author in this [paper](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-21-0337.1/JCLI-D-21-0337.1.xml) showing that ocean models having Langmuir turbulence and submesoscale restratification parameterizations give the most accurate simulation of monsoon intraseasonal oscillation events.
