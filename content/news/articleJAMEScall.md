MÂ²LInES members Janni Yuval is the lead author in this [article](https://eos.org/editors-vox/call-for-papers-on-machine-learning-and-earth-system-modeling) inviting scientists to contribute to a new special collection in _Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems_ (_JAMES_). The collection will focus on the use of new machine learning methodologies and applications of machine learning to Earth system modeling. Pierre Gentine and Laure Zanna are co-authors of the article.
