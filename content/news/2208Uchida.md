This [study](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2022-27) presents a cloud-based workflow for intercomparing high-resolution ocean models and provides an assessment of one of the most used parameterizations of ocean submesoscales. Julien Le Sommer, Ryan Abernathey, and Aurelie Albert contributed to the research.
