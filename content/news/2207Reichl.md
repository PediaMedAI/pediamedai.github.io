Analysis of the ocean mixed layer requires one to estimate its vertical extent, for which there are various definitions. In this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JC018140), Brandon Reichl and co-authors, including Alistair Adcroft, show that using the potential energy anomaly to identify the mixed layer depth is practical and it offers conceptual benefits by directly linking to the physics of upper ocean vertical mixing.
