Will Gregory and co-authors hypothesized in this [publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1653-2022) that regional biases in sea ice thickness may hinder the ability of CMIP6 models to reproduce an important atmospheric driver of summer sea ice variability, and hence their ability to make reliable sea ice predictions on seasonal to inter-annual time scales.
