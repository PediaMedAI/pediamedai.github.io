In this [paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03456259/document), Hugo Frezat, Julien Le Sommer, and their co-authors, train a NN-based closures for QG dynamics with an a posteriori learning criteria based on model integrations over several time-steps. While this strategy yields closures which outperform existing baselines, it requires the coarse resolution model to be  differentiable in order to minimize the training loss.
