In this [article](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-21-0544.1/JCLI-D-21-0544.1.xml), Mitch Bushuk and co-authors evaluate regional Arctic sea ice extent predictions made with the FLOR and SPEAR_MED dynamical seasonal forecast systems, and investigate the mechanisms of predictability in these systems. Feiyu Lu also contributed to the research.
